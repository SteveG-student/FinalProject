In the current state, there is the basic setup for a muti-user chat interface.  You are required to enter the IP address manually in the code currently and it uses a random socket that is generally open for communication.

Currently to run the program you simply need to run the server.py file from the host machine in a command prompt.  Then the client can open their client.py file, also in a command prompt.  This will allow two(or more) clients to interact through a text based chat.
